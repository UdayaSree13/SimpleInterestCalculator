This project is a Simple Interest Calculator built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to quickly calculate the simple interest based on the principal amount, rate of interest, and time period entered.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5** - Structure of the webpage

## Example

- Principal = \$1000
- Rate = 5%
- Time = 2 years

**Simple Interest =** (1000 × 5 × 2) / 100 = **\$100**
